Need to Learn algorithms:
Silver:
	1. BFS/DFS (Depth/Breadth first searches): done
	2. prefix sum: done
	3. Floodfill: done
	4. Greedy Algorithm: done
	5. Ad Hoc Problems
		These problems don't have standard solutions
Gold:
	1. Dijkstra: 
	2. Minimum Spanning Tree
	3. Dynamic programmin
	4. Greedy
	5. Ad Hoc Problems
		These problems don't have standard solutions


Plat:
	1. Data structures: 
		segment tree: done
		fenwick tree: 
		disjoint sets
		Heavy-Light Decomposition
	2.  Greedy, dynamic programming, and data structures combined:
	3. Graph Algorithms 
		Least common ancestors 
		others
	4. Computational Geomtry
	5. Ad Hoc Problems
		These problems don't have standard solutions
